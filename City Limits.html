	<p>My relationship with Marc really began when I remixed one of his songs. He was the only other person in my school who made music, so it just made sense to me. Eventually we made a music video to this remix - directed by me. &nbsp;</p>

    <p>After working with me on 'Happy People on Late Night TV' he asked me to produce his debut EP "City Limits". This was released in the same year, and featured simple instrumentation with a nice, chilled out tone. It is worth mentioning that all of these music projects were made on the smallest budget imaginable, funded entirely by my earnings from three different jobs. Music has always been something I have done entirely for fun.  &nbsp;</p>
