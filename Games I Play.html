    <p>While I completed my undergraduate studies, music was always on my mind. When another artist approached me asking for me to produce her debut EP, I said yes. Katie and I worked on this EP for a few months, and unlike all my previous projects I was not really involved in the writing process. I wrote small instumental parts but the bulk of the writing was done by Katie herself. Similarly to my previous work though, I was in charge of the recording, producing, engineering, mixing and mastering.&nbsp;</p>
