    <p>Following my work on 'Games I Play', Katie asked me to produce her follow-up EP. We worked on this in a very similar way, taking a few months to really focus on completing the project. After releasing the first teaser single "Second Single Bed" Katie found viral success on TikTok and subsequently signed to Columbia Records. This single was recorded, produced, engineered, mixed and mastered by me.  &nbsp;</p>
