    <p>After working with Marc on his EP, we decided to form a band. The initial members were me, Marc and my friend Kirsty. Together we worked on our debut EP "Subliminal", which released later in the same year. I think I released so much music in 2018 as it was my final year before university, and I think I knew how little time I would have to work on music once my undergraduate studies began.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;The opening track for this EP was well recieved by critics, with The Herald ranking it as the fourth best song to come from a Scottish artist in 2018.</p>
