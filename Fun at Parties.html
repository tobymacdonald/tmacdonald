    <p>Having released a few singles (Bottled Honey, Jazz, Lonely) since our debut EP, Marc and I figured it was time for us to release a more fleshed out project. Kirsty had left the band after our first Ep to pursue a career as a surf instructor in Cornwall, so the band had now become more of a duo. We still call ourselves a band though. It felt great to be more creatively involved again, as the last few projects I had worked on hadn't involved much writing from me. For 'Fun at Parties' I was able to again control the creative direction and design the album art. This EP was very fulfilling to make, and is still the project I am most fond of to this day. It was completed all whilst pursuing my final year of undergraduate studies.&nbsp;</p>
