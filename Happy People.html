    <p>When I was 17, I released my debut album "Happy People on Late Night TV" which was entirely self recorded, engineered and produced featuring instrumentals and vocals from basically everyone in Nairn who was willing to help. I have since removed this album from streaming platforms because I don't like it any more. It feels like the album equivalent of a child's artwork that gets put on the fridge... I am very proud of the work that went into it and what it represented, however the execution isn't up to the standard I want associated with my discography.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;A music critic seemed to like one of the songs though, and uploaded a copy of the song to YouTube. I had no input regarding the video or the method of censorship. I find the video bizarre.</p>
